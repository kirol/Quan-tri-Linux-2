ntpdate 


I get this message when ntpd starts: ntpdate: no server suitable for synchronization found 
That's not necessarily an error. Many times ntpdate doesn't trust the time server(s) it's talking to and ignores it (or them). ntpdate is really not needed--it sets the time immediately before the ntpd server starts. ntpd will gradually adjusts the time over a few minutes or several hours depending on how out of sync the local time is. To really see if ntpd is working, wait about 20 minutes after starting ntpd and type the following: ntpq -c peers


Tren server
vi /etc/ntp.conf
restrict 192.168.146.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
service ntpd restart


Tren client 
vi /etc/ntp.conf
